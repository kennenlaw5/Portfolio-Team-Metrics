# Portfolio-Team-Metrics
Portfolio Team Metrics repo for the code to run the sheet. Will pull variables from a imported sheet (name TBD) and pull values from it and add them to a User Specified Sheet Name (will most likely be a dropdown from the menu itself). Will MOST LIKELY have to pull a different set of values from a DIFFERENT sheet and put those values on the sheet specified by the name value that is on the source sheet. This will be done later and is NOT important at this time. Disregard the second pull as it will be its own function later!!!! RECOMMENDATION: Create ONE function, that will retrieve the data and analyze it/sort it correctly then return the corrected data back on the main sheet. 
The driver function that will call the other two functions will be named dataPull(). For now, leave this function alone as instead of user input we will have AUTOMATED input based on client advisors name. dataPull() will only be set up AFTER we know what the second sheet they need scraped will look like.
Spreadsheet Name: Portfolio Team Metrics 2018 BETA
For now, the source sheet to pull data FROM is called "Lease Portfolio" but this will not stay consistent. Have function run with this page active. User SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet(); as opposed to getting source sheet by a specific name.
